Hey Bekah! Great start to the resume. I thought the set up was really nice, one thing for me is I like to put my skills in programming languages or other sort of general skills in its own section rather then under education but that is mostly a personal preference. Since you seem to have a lot of experience in many languages though I would maybe recommend making a ranking of maybe what languages you are most comfortable or familiar with to the least so companies could see how well you may know a language they are particularly interested in for a job. 

For the Projects Section, now that you have a github account, you could upload those projects to your Github as well and have links to those projects so companies could even see exactly what you did.

Otherwise I thought it looked great.
